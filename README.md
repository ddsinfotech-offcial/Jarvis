 **Note**: (or) is used for multiple commands 

Next, compile the project (respecting if `make` or `gmake` is needed):

 * Compilation:

    `make`

 * Compilation on *BSD or Solaris:

    `gmake`

Finally, the additional targets listed below may be of use in your environment:

 * Execute all unit testing:

    `make check`

 * Execute all integration testing (requires root):
 
    `make integration`

 * Installing:

    `make install`

 * Uninstall:

    `make uninstall`


###  `./configure` flags

When configuring, the following flags can be used and combined to adjust the suite
to your choosing:

* **with-airpcap=DIR**:  needed for supporting airpcap devices on windows (cygwin or msys2 only)
                Replace DIR above with the absolute location to the root of the
                extracted source code from the Airpcap CD or downloaded SDK available
                online. Required on Windows to build `besside-ng`, `besside-ng-crawler`, 
                `easside-ng`, `tkiptun-ng` and `wesside-ng` when building experimental tools.
                The developer pack (Compatible with version 4.1.1 and 4.1.3) can be downloaded at
                https://support.riverbed.com/content/support/software/steelcentral-npm/airpcap.html

* **with-experimental**: needed to compile `tkiptun-ng`, `easside-ng`, `buddy-ng`,
                    `buddy-ng-crawler`, `airventriloquist` and `wesside-ng`.
                    libpcap development package is also required to compile most of the tools.
                    If not present, not all experimental tools will be built.
                    On Cygwin, libpcap is not present and the Airpcap SDK replaces it.
                    See --with-airpcap option above.

* **with-ext-scripts**: needed to build `airoscript-ng`, `versuck-ng`, `airgraph-ng` and 
                   `airdrop-ng`. 
                   Note: Each script has its own dependencies.

* **with-gcrypt**:   Use libgcrypt crypto library instead of the default OpenSSL.
                And also use internal fast sha1 implementation (borrowed from GIT)
                Dependency (Debian): libgcrypt20-dev

* **with-duma**:	Compile with DUMA support. DUMA is a library to detect buffer overruns and under-runs.
            	Dependencies (debian): duma

* **disable-libnl**:  Set-up the project to be compiled without libnl (1 or 3). Linux option only.

* **without-opt**:  Do not enable stack protector (on GCC 4.9 and above).

* **enable-shared**:   Make OSdep a shared library.

* **disable-shared**: When combined with **enable-static**, it will statically compile Aircrack-ng.

* **with-avx512**:  On x86, add support for AVX512 instructions in aircrack-ng. Only use it when
                    the current CPU supports AVX512.

* **with-static-simd=<SIMD>**: Compile a single optimization in aircrack-ng binary. Useful when compiling
                    statically and/or for space-constrained devices. Valid SIMD options: x86-sse2,
                    x86-avx, x86-avx2, x86-avx512, ppc-altivec, ppc-power8, arm-neon, arm-asimd.
                    Must be used with --enable-static --disable-shared. When using those 2 options, the default
                    is to compile the generic optimization in the binary. --with-static-simd merely allows
                    to choose another one.

* **enable-maintainer-mode**: It is important to enable this flag when developing with Aircrack-ng. This flag enables additional compile warnings and safety features.

#### Examples:

  * Configure and compiling:

    ```
    ./configure --with-experimental
    make
    ```

  * Compiling with gcrypt:

    ```
    ./configure --with-gcrypt
    make
    ```

  * Installing:

    `make install`

  * Installing (strip binaries):
  
    `make install-strip`

  * Installing, with external scripts:

    ```
    ./configure --with-experimental --with-ext-scripts
    make
    make install
    ```

  * Testing (with sqlite, experimental and pcre)

    ```
    ./configure --with-experimental
    make
    make check
    ```

  * Compiling on OS X with macports (and all options):

    ```
    ./configure --with-experimental
    gmake
    ```

  * Compiling on OS X 10.10 with XCode 7.1 and Homebrew:

    ```
    env CC=gcc-4.9 CXX=g++-4.9 ./configure
    make
    make check
    ```

    *NOTE*: Older XCode ships with a version of LLVM that does not support CPU feature
    detection; which causes the `./configure` to fail. To work around this older LLVM,
    it is required that a different compile suite is used, such as GCC or a newer LLVM
    from Homebrew.

    If you wish to use OpenSSL from Homebrew, you may need to specify the location
    to its' installation. To figure out where OpenSSL lives, run:

    `brew --prefix openssl`

    Use the output above as the DIR for `--with-openssl=DIR` in the `./configure` line:

    ```
    env CC=gcc-4.9 CXX=g++-4.9 ./configure --with-openssl=DIR
    make
    make check
    ```

  * Compiling on FreeBSD with gcc9

    ```
    env CC=gcc9 CXX=g++9 MAKE=gmake ./configure
    gmake
    ```

  * Compiling on Cygwin with Airpcap (assuming Airpcap devpack is unpacked in Aircrack-ng directory)

    ```
    cp -vfp Airpcap_Devpack/bin/x86/airpcap.dll src
    cp -vfp Airpcap_Devpack/bin/x86/airpcap.dll src/aircrack-osdep
    cp -vfp Airpcap_Devpack/bin/x86/airpcap.dll src/aircrack-crypto
    cp -vfp Airpcap_Devpack/bin/x86/airpcap.dll src/aircrack-util
    dlltool -D Airpcap_Devpack/bin/x86/airpcap.dll -d build/airpcap.dll.def -l Airpcap_Devpack/bin/x86/libairpcap.dll.a
    autoreconf -i
    ./configure --with-experimental --with-airpcap=$(pwd)
    make
    ```

 * Compiling on DragonflyBSD with gcrypt using GCC 8

   ```
   autoreconf -i
   env CC=gcc8 CXX=g++8 MAKE=gmake ./configure --with-experimental --with-gcrypt
   gmake
   ```

 * Compiling on OpenBSD (with autoconf 2.69 and automake 1.16)

   ```
   export AUTOCONF_VERSION=2.69
   export AUTOMAKE_VERSION=1.16
   autoreconf -i
   env MAKE=gmake ./configure
   gmake
   ```

 * Compiling and debugging aircrack-ng

   ```
   export CFLAGS='-O0 -g'
   export CXXFLAGS='-O0 -g'
   ./configure --with-experimental --enable-maintainer-mode --without-opt
   make
   LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.libs gdb --args ./aircrack-ng [PARAMETERS]
   ```


# Packaging

Automatic detection of CPU optimization is done at run time. This behavior
**is** desirable when packaging Aircrack-ng (for a Linux or other distribution.)

Also, in some cases it may be desired to provide your own flags completely and
not having the suite auto-detect a number of optimizations. To do this, add
the additional flag `--without-opt` to the `./configure` line:

`./configure --without-opt`

# Using precompiled binaries

## Linux/BSD
 * Use your package manager to download aircrack-ng
 * In most cases, they have an old version.

## Windows
 * Install the appropriate "monitor" driver for your card (standard drivers doesn't work for capturing data).
 * aircrack-ng suite is command line tools. So, you have to open a commandline
   `Start menu -> Run... -> cmd.exe` then use them
 * Run the executables without any parameters to have help
